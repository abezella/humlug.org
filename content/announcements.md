John will discuss the Internet-in-a-Box project and demo an installation with 700GB of offline educational resources available through a wireless hotspot.
Learn how you can set up a machine with offline versions of Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, calibre-web, Lokole email, Khan Academy, Kolibri, MediaWiki, Moodle, NextCloud, Open Street Maps, Stack Exchange, Node Red, TEDTalks, WordPress and a selection of other useful open-source offline educational resources.
